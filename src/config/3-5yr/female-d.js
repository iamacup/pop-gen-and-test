// percentages
// - subtype - lookup - will lookup the options based on the percentages and spread out over the remaining options that are not specified
// - subtype - pick - will split based on the optiosn provided (free text)

// dates
// - month can be string rand (a random month will be picked) or an integer, 1 through 12
// - yearsAgo must be an integer that is number of years ago (which could be 0 if to use 2018)

// structure of section 2-1 is slightly different - NOTE we do not currently support multiple universities in generation!
// we supply a BASE object with a qualificationLoops object which sets up the percentage likelyhood of multiple qualifications happening
// we then specify the data for each loop inside of the qualifications array like we would for any other (Accepts normal arguments)
